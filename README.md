What is Queue of Questions?
---------------------------

Micro web/mobile app, where you can create a topic and submit a question of any kind, when you feel shy, forgetful or just for fun. Useful for larger or regular or cross location meetings, when during Q/A sessions you only hear silence. Gather questions during the meeting or in advance and let team lead to answer them directly online or during the meeting.

Users can vote by starring each question, to allow focus to most interesting questions first.

Might be also used as meeting agenda, meeting minutes, reminder or as a quick poll, feel free to find your best use of it.
